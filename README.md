Data from bots built by Kahhow and Joe<br><br>

**Context**: ~100 teachers registered for access for CherGPT and used it for teaching and learning<br>
The String team compiled 26525 prompts and responses. There are some breaks in the responses and errors:<br>
``Error in doPost(): Limiet overschreden: Lengte URLFetch-URL.1``<br>
